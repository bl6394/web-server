<h1>Database News and Update - August 31, 2019</h1>
<p>We (thanks to Bjorn Loftis) have upgraded the ELP to another platform to be more efficient, while still maintaining the same interface.  We have also added a set of Semantic Variables to the ELP.  The specific citations for the semantic variables are below for each of these variables.  We thank each of the following authors for developing such useful norms.</p>
<h2>Citations for New Semantic Variables</h2>

<p>In addition, over the years we often receive requests for the full behavioral dataset including the trial level data.  Therefore, we (thanks to Melvin Yap) have provided links to two full sets of all trial level data, which reflects the full LDT and Naming datasets.</p>
